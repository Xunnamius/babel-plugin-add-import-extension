# babel-plugin-transform-rewrite-imports

A babel plugin that reliably adds extensions to import specifiers that do not
already have one, selectively replaces extensions of specifiers that do, and can
even rewrite specifiers entirely if desired. This plugin comes in handy in
situations like transpiling TypeScript source to ESM while maintaining the
ergonomic advantage of TypeScript/NodeJS extensionless imports.

This plugin started off as a fork of
[babel-plugin-transform-rewrite-imports][link-npm] that functions [more
consistently][1], including support for dynamic imports, mapping between
multiple extensions, and [reliably ignoring extensions that should not be
replaced][2].

This plugin is similar in intent to [babel-plugin-replace-import-extension][3]
and [babel-plugin-transform-rename-import][4] but with the ability to append
extensions to import specifiers that do not already have one.

## Install

```Shell
npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-transform-rewrite-imports
```

And in your `babel.config.js`:

```JavaScript
module.exports = {
  plugins: ['babel-plugin-transform-rewrite-imports', {
    // See below for configuration instructions
  }]
};
```

Finally, run Babel through your toolchain (Webpack, Jest, etc) or manually:

```Shell
npx babel src --out-dir dist
```

## Usage

By default this plugin does not affect babel's output. You must explicitly
configure this extension before any specifier will be rewritten.

To append an extension to all relative import specifiers that do not already
have a recognized extension, use `appendExtension`:

```JavaScript
module.exports = {
  ['babel-plugin-transform-rewrite-imports', {
    appendExtension: '.mjs'
  }]
};
```

> Only relative import specifiers (that start with `./` or `../`) will be
> considered for `appendExtension`. This means bare specifiers (e.g. built-in
> packages and packages imported from `node_modules`) and absolute specifiers
> will never be affected by `appendExtension`.

What is and is not considered a "recognized extension" is determined by
`recognizedExtensions`:

```JavaScript
module.exports = {
  plugins: ['babel-plugin-transform-rewrite-imports', {
    appendExtension: '.mjs',
    recognizedExtensions: ['.js']
  }]
};
```

That is: **import specifiers that end with an extension included in
`recognizedExtensions` will never have `appendExtension` appended to them**. All
other imports, including those with a `.` in the file name (e.g.
`component.module.style.ts`), may be rewritten.

`recognizedExtensions` is set to `['.js', '.jsx', '.mjs', '.cjs', '.json']` by
default.

> Note that specifying a custom value for `recognizedExtensions` overwrites the
> default value entirely.

You can also replace one or more existing extensions by specifying a replacement
map:

```JavaScript
module.exports = {
  plugins: ['babel-plugin-transform-rewrite-imports', {
    replace: {
      // Replacements are evaluated **in order**! That means if the following
      // two keys were listed in reverse order, .node.js would become
      // .node.mjs instead of .cjs
      '.node.js': '.cjs',
      // Since .js is in recognizedExtensions, file.js would not be rewritten.
      // Instead, since .js is a key of replace, file.js becomes file.mjs
      '.js': '.mjs',
    }
  }]
};
```

These configurations can be combined to rewrite many imports at once. For
instance, if you wanted to replace certain extensions and append only when no
known or listed extension is specified:

```JavaScript
module.exports = {
  plugins: ['babel-plugin-transform-rewrite-imports', {
    appendExtension: '.mjs',
    replace: {
      '.node.js': '.cjs',
      '.js': '.mjs',
    }
  }]
};
```

`appendExtension` and `replace` accept any string, not just those that begin
with `.`; additionally, `replace` accepts _regular expressions_. This allows you
to partially or entirely rewrite a specifier:

```JavaScript
module.exports = {
  plugins: ['babel-plugin-transform-rewrite-imports', {
    appendExtension: '.mjs',
    // Add .css to recognizedExtensions so .mjs isn't automatically appended
    recognizedExtensions: ['.js', '.jsx', '.mjs', '.cjs', '.json', '.css'],
    replace: {
      '.node.js': '.cjs',
      '.js': '.mjs',

      // The following key replaces the entire specifier when matched
      '^package$': `${__dirname}/package.json`,
      // If .css wasn't in recognizedExtensions, my-utils/src/file.less would
      // become my-utils/src/file.css.mjs instead of my-utils/src/file.css
      '(.+?)\\.less$': '$1.css'
    }
  }]
};
```

> If a key of `replace` begins with `^` _or_ ends with `$`, it is considered a
> regular expression instead of an extension. Regular expression replacements
> support substitutions as well (e.g. `$1`, `$2`, etc).

`replace` is evaluated and replacements made before `appendExtension` is
considered. This means an extensionless import specifier could be rewritten by
`replace` to have an extension, which would then be ignored by `appendExtension`
when normally it would have been considered.

## Examples

With the following configuration:

```JavaScript
module.exports = {
  plugins: ['babel-plugin-transform-rewrite-imports', {
    appendExtension: '.mjs',
    recognizedExtensions: ['.js', '.jsx', '.mjs', '.cjs', '.json', '.css'],
    replace: {
      '.ts': '.mjs',
      '^package$': `${__dirname}/package.json`,
      '(.+?)\\.less$': '$1.css'
    }
  }]
};
```

The following source:

```JavaScript
import { name as pkgName } from 'package';
import jsConfig from './jsconfig.json';
import projectConfig from './project.config.cjs';
import { add, double } from './src/numbers';
import { curry } from './src/typed/curry.ts';
import styles from './src/less/styles.less';

export { triple, quadruple } from './lib/num-utils';
```

Is transformed to:

```JavaScript
import { name as pkgName } from '/absolute/path/to/project/package.json';
import jsConfig from './jsconfig.json';
import projectConfig from './project.config.cjs';
import { add, double } from './src/numbers.mjs';
import { curry } from './src/typed/curry.mjs';
import styles from './src/less/styles.css';

export { triple, quadruple } from './lib/num-utils.mjs';
```

## Documentation

> Further documentation can be found under [`docs/`][docs].

This is a [CJS2 package][cjs-mojito] with statically-analyzable exports built by
Babel for Node14 and above. That means both CJS2 (via `require(...)`) and ESM
(via `import { ... } from ...` or `await import(...)`) source will load this
package from the same entry points when using Node. This has several benefits,
the foremost being: less code shipped/smaller package size, avoiding [dual
package hazard][dual-package-hazard] entirely, distributables are not
packed/bundled/uglified, and a less complex build process.

Each entry point (i.e. `ENTRY`) in [`package.json`'s
`exports[ENTRY]`][package-json] object includes one or more [export
conditions][exports-conditions]. These entries may or may not include: an
[`exports[ENTRY].types`][exports-types-key] condition pointing to a type
declarations file for TypeScript and IDEs, an
[`exports[ENTRY].module`][exports-module-key] condition pointing to (usually
ESM) source for Webpack/Rollup, an `exports[ENTRY].node` condition pointing to
(usually CJS2) source for Node.js `require` _and `import`_, an
`exports[ENTRY].default` condition pointing to (usually ESM) source for browsers
and other environments, and [other conditions][exports-conditions] not
enumerated here. Check the [package.json][package-json] file to see which export
conditions are supported.

Though [`package.json`][package-json] includes
[`{ "type": "commonjs" }`][local-pkg], note that the ESM entry points are ES
module (`.mjs`) files. Finally, [`package.json`][package-json] also includes the
[`sideEffects`][side-effects-key] key, which is `false` for optimal [tree
shaking][tree-shaking].
